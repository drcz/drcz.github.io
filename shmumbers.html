<p>These are some examples I’ve been showing to many people, up to the
point where I started feeling like my grandma, telling same joke each
Sunday. So I decided to write it down and only keep handing the link,
which saves us all some time.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-more-unreal-than-the-real-line">Nothing more unreal than
the real line</h2>
<p>If you’ve studied any mathematics you might have already developed
some justified worries about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number">the real line</a>. For
example, people can’t figure out its basic structure like which subsets
are there, and the science trying to clean up this mess turned into <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_set_theory">massive
endeavor</a>, and apparently they do use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_(mathematics)">forcing</a>
which should be a red light to any sane person.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we’re interested in digital computers and computer
programs so who cares about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitali_set">Vitali sets</a> and
other Borelian nonsense? The first order theory of (a field of) real
numbers is decidable, so as long as we’re doing computations, one number
at a time, we’re good. Right?</p>
<p>Well, it’s not that great. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3

<p>Hmm. Probably that’s why I didn’t use Pandas or whatever is fancy
now… In my times (grandma mode) we used R.</p>
<pre><code>$ R

<p>Oww… And it’s like that almost everywhere, and of course it has to
be. Any kid knows how <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">floating-point
representation</a> works, and any reasonable teenager had already
figured you can’t fit arbitrary <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_of_the_real_numbers#Construction_from_Cauchy_sequences">Cauchy
sequence</a> into 64bits. Since if you could, that would mean there are
at most <code>18 446 744 073 709 551 616</code> real numbers. So we’re
cutting some corners, but how could it harm anyone?</p>
<p>I’ll tell you how it harmed me, or rather a simulation we were doing
at the University.</p>
<p>We were experimenting with a simple 1-dimensional continuous discrete
dynamical system <code>([0,1],φ)</code> where</p>
<pre><code>       ⎧    3x, x∈[0,1/3]
φ(x) = ⎨ -3x+2, x∈(1/3,2/3]
       ⎩  3x-2, x∈(2/3,1]</code></pre>
<p>In other words we were taking points (“real numbers”) between
<code>0</code> and <code>1</code> and checking out what happens when you
apply φ multiple times, like this (in R):</p>
<pre><code>phi &lt;- function(x) {
         ifelse(x &lt; 1/3, 3*x,
                ifelse(x &lt;= 2/3, -3*x+2,
                       3*x-2))
}</code></pre>
<p>for example <code>φ(0.7) = 0.1</code>, then
<code>φ(φ(0.7) = φ(0.1) = 0.3</code>,
<code>φ(φ(φ(0.7))) = φ(0.3) = 0.9</code> etc. :</p>
<pre><code>&gt; phi(0.7)
[1] 0.1
&gt; phi(0.1)
[1] 0.3
&gt; phi(0.3)
[1] 0.9
&gt; phi(0.9)
[1] 0.7</code></pre>
<p>So far so good. From the above example it’s obvious (and paper and
pencil confirm that beyond any doubt) <code>7/10</code> is a point of
period 4, meaning its trajectory will just oscillate through these four:
<code>1/10</code>,<code>3/10</code>,<code>9/10</code>,<code>7/10</code>.
Now, since there are hardly any numbers larger than <code>13</code>
(maybe <code>23</code> and <code>42</code>) this is what we carelessly
confirmed:</p>
<pre><code>trajectory &lt;- function(f,x0,n) {
  t &lt;- c()
  for(i in 0:n) {
    t &lt;- append(t,x0)
    x0 &lt;- f(x0)
  }
  t
}

&gt; trajectory(phi,0.7,13)
 [1] 0.7 0.1 0.3 0.9 0.7 0.1 0.3 0.9 0.7 0.1 0.3 0.9 0.7 0.1</code></pre>
<p>Great. So what’s the problem? Things got weird when we started
plotting accumulated statistics from pulling thousands of points via the
system… it took a while to realize the above program does not work as
expected. Look:</p>

<p>Turns out we have been fooled by R’s truncated display of the
“numbers” and after 15 steps the tiny fluctuation becomes visible…
Analytically periodic point literally left its orbit, and the further
you go, the more it’s all over the place… In IEEE754’s defense, this
system is chaotic (hint: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Yorke#Contributions">Li-Yorke
theorem</a> and look at the plot of 3-fold composition of φ and forget
the 3 fixpoints — clearly there are 23 points of period 3, which implies
chaos because Heil Eris!)</p>
<p>Eventually, in order to get correct data for our experiments, we
switched from floating-point “real numbers” to bignum-based “rational
numbers” which are one of the builtin numerical types in Scheme (also
since Scheme’s syntax is so clean, we could use Unicode φ, how cool is
that?!)</p>
<pre><code>(define (φ x)
  (cond ((&lt; x 1/3) (* x 3))
        ((&lt; x 2/3) (+ (* -3 x) 2))
        (else (- (* 3 x) 2))))
        
(define (trajectory φ x0 n)
  (if (&gt; n 0)
      `(,x0 . ,(trajectory f (f x0) (- n 1)))
      &#39;()))</code></pre>
<p>Which has no problems and can be casted to doubles afterwards:</p>
<pre><code>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (trajectory φ 7/10 100)

<p>These issues with floats and doubles were pretty obvious to our
grandparents who wrote most of currently used numerical code in Fortran.
Since then nobody knows how it works and we just have to preserve
it.</p>

<p>Now obviously bignum doesn’t solve all our problems, but it does
solve one, which is already easy to miss:</p>
<pre><code>scala&gt; 65536*65536

<p>Apparently 65536 is a divisor of 0. You might think it’s obvious, but
then it’s not immediately obvious the following C procedure does NOT

<p>Sweet, isn’t it? And not any better with <code>unsigned int</code>,
while relying on bignum instead only pushes these problems a bit
further. At first glance it’s <em>a lot</em> further, but still within a
reach a good old combinatorial explosion (go on, feed
<code>trajectory</code> with <code>factorial</code> and some moderately
large number and enjoy the flight).</p>
<p>This can get pretty dangerous, for example I do believe programmers
in the aviation industry are nothing less than brilliant and careful,
stick to the “best practices” and testing and all that. Yet, look at <a
href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/05/01/787_software_bug_can_shut_down_planes_generators/">this</a>
(TL;DR Boeing 787 planes need to be “reset” every 200 days or so,
<em>“because a software bug shuts down the plane’s electricity
generators every 248 days”</em> and apparently said bug is related to
hitting the limit of what <code>unsigned int</code> can represent).</p>
<p>Similar problems hold for practically any computable arithmetic
function (unless it’s not defined only on a small finite subset of
natural numbers). We never compute them, we have some artifacts which
clearly do something and seem to fit the definitions, but they’re
nothing like “the real thing” — they can’t be because “the real thing”
doesn’t even exist. It’s just a opinion, but a strong one. Even the very
large finite things can’t exist, but for this consult e.g. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafinitism">wiki</a>. I recall
there was a neat anecdote about Esenin-Volpin in some early chapters of
<em>“Naming Infinity: A True Story of Religious Mysticism and
Mathematical Creativity”</em> by Loren Graham and Jean-Michel Kantor
(Harvard University Press, 2009) but I had the book borrowed, so I can’t
reproduce it faithfully enough now.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this way too long rant I tried to make three points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Being pedantic about the language used (like
<code>numerals</code> instead of <code>numbers</code>) can save your
plane from requiring to be turned off and on again.</p></li>
<li><p>But even then you’ll have to reset your hardware from time to
time (think of a processor as a discrete dynamical system, we just lose
track of its trajectory when it passes certain threshold). Neither TDD
nor formal methods will save you. Accept failures and prepare plan B
“just in case”.</p></li>
<li><p>No such thing as numbers or arithmetic functions exist, but also
nothing else exists, yet we can have lots of fun with all these things,
and it’s more important to have fun than ontological positions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although I really meant only this: <strong>next time you ask me
<em>“So, does it work now?”</em> don’t be puzzled I reply <em>“We may
never know”</em> — I do mean it!</strong></p>
